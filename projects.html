            <h1>University Management System - Java & Eclipse IDE</h1>
            <p>The University Management System (UMS Lite) is a system designed to manipulate data from a database provided by a university.
               It uses 2 Java based systems, back-end and front-end.
                The back-end system is connected directly to the database and uses Spring Boot to create a REST API to create the HTTP methods,
                POST, PUT, GET and DELETE which perform basic database operations. The front-end system is a JavaFX application which handles the UI and user interaction,
                it connects to the back-end system using HTTP requests.</p>
